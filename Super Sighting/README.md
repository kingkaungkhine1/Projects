A project I worked on while at mThree/The Software Guild. Has a front end with HTML/CSS simplified with bootstrap and using Spring. Front end interacts with main Java program. Java program connects to MySQL database to read and write data. Test functions also written.

Users can create, edit, and delete super heroes, powers, locations, sightings, and organizations. 

Used JPA Repo, REST, Spring, SQL, JQuery, Thymeleaf

Home page that displays general information about the application, navigation to all the other pages, and a newsfeed of the latest 10 sightings in the database.
